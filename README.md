# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This weeks homework assignment was to build mobile responsive website featuring a Navigation Bar, Sticky Footer and Main Content for each Page using the Bootstrap Framework/Library. The website is requred to pass a HTML Validator with no faults and meet accessibilty standards. For Accessibility and Good Practice, Semantic tags (header, footer, aside, section, main, IDs) title tags for all links to display what will happen upon click. I did not think the styling and content such as typing and photos of the website mattered too much, as long as it displays a similar format and proves you have to knowledge to create a bootstrap layout. I linked social media as requested even though i don't use social media at all, i don't have a twitter account so Michael Jordan's will have to do.
